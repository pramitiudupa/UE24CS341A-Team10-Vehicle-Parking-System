# Vehicle Parking System — Team 10

**Software Engineering (UE24CS341A) Mini-Project · Semester 5 · Section F · PES University, Bengaluru**

A web-based system for managing parking slots and tracking vehicles. Parking attendants register vehicles, check slot availability, record vehicle entry and exit, and search for a vehicle to see where it is parked and its history. On entry the system allocates a matching slot; on exit it calculates the fee and releases the slot. The fee uses hourly rates with a fixed 15-minute grace period. Administrators also manage slots, users and hourly rates, and generate the parking occupancy report.

| 2 | Software Test Plan (IEEE format, with 37 test cases) | [`docs/TestPlan/`](docs/TestPlan/) | ✅ Final v1.1 ([PDF](docs/TestPlan/Vehicle_Parking_System_Test_Plan_v1.1.pdf)) |
| 3 | Software Architecture & Design Specification (SAD) | [`docs/SAD/`](docs/SAD/) | ✅ Final v1.1 ([PDF](docs/SAD/Team10_Vehicle_Parking_System_SAD.pdf)) |
| 4 | Implementation start + sprint activity | [`docs/Sprint-Plan.md`](docs/Sprint-Plan.md) | Sprint 1 planned |

## SAD at a glance

The SRS, SAD and Test Plan all use the same requirement IDs: FR-01…FR-23, NFR-01…NFR-07, SEC-01…SEC-07 and BR-01…BR-05. They also share the same test-case IDs. Every requirement maps to a component, a design section and at least one test case (SAD §3.8).

- **Architecture:** Layered three-tier (React SPA → Express REST API → MongoDB replica set), with the routes, security middleware, services and repositories kept in separate layers.
- **Components** (the names used in the SRS RTM): Security Middleware, Auth Service, User Management Service, Vehicle Service, Parking Slot Service, Parking Transaction Service, Fee Service, Report Service, Database Layer.
- **Key design points:** slot allocation and exit run inside transactions, backed by unique indexes, so a slot can never hold two vehicles. The fee is billable hours × hourly rate, after a fixed 15-minute grace period. Each JWT is tied to a server-side session, which lets logout cancel the token and ends the session after 15 minutes idle. Also: bcrypt hashing, server-side role checks (Parking Attendant / Administrator) and TLS. Threats are analysed with a STRIDE model.
