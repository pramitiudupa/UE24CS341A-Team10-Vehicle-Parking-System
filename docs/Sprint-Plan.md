# Product Backlog & Sprint Plan — Vehicle Parking System (Team 10)

SE Mini-Project **Part-2**. The backlog has one GitHub issue per functional and non-functional requirement in [SRS v1.1](SRS/Vehicle_Parking_System_SRS_v1.1.pdf) (FR, NFR and the SEC security NFRs), plus one setup/CI task. Each issue includes the requirement text exactly as written in the SRS, acceptance criteria taken from the [Test Plan v1.1](TestPlan/Vehicle_Parking_System_Test_Plan_v1.1.pdf), the story points, the assignee and the sprint. Each issue also has a link to the design in the [SAD v1.1](SAD/Team10_Vehicle_Parking_System_SAD.pdf).

- **Issues:** [https://github.com/pramitiudupa/UE24CS341A-Team10-Vehicle-Parking-System/issues](https://github.com/pramitiudupa/UE24CS341A-Team10-Vehicle-Parking-System/issues), filterable by milestone **Sprint 1** / **Sprint 2**, by assignee, or by label `sp:N`
- **Story points:** Fibonacci scale (1, 2, 3, 5), based on relative size and risk
- **Dry run:** 12–16 Oct (practice sprint); the backlog may still be adjusted on 19 Oct

## Workflow (Part-2 rules)

1. The assignee creates a branch `feature/<issue-no>-<short-name>` from `main`.
2. The assignee commits with the issue number in the message (e.g. `FR-11: record vehicle entry (#12)`) and **raises the pull request**, with `Closes #<issue>` in the PR description.
3. GitHub Actions runs lint and tests on the PR.
4. The repo owner (@pramitiudupa) reviews and merges the PR.
5. Any deviation from the SRS, SAD or Test Plan is noted in the PR and recorded in `docs/Deviations.md` for the final demo.
6. At the end of each sprint, a short video of the working product is uploaded to `docs/videos/` (1 minute for Sprint 1, 2 minutes for Sprint 2).
